Character IO

Write a program that asks a user for an input file name, and also a vowel. The program reads text from the 
input file specified by the user. For each line it displays how many times the vowel appears on that line. 
It also displays the thtal number of times the vowel appears in the file when all the data is read.

This program should define a function called 'readInput' that has two parameters. The first parameter is an 
input-file stream and the second parameter is of type character. This function reads from the input-file 
stream, and displays the number of times the second parameter (the requested vowel) appears on each line. It
also displays the total number of times the second parameter appears in the file.

The main function prompts for and reads in the input file name and a vowel. It opens the file, and then calls
'readInput' with the input-file stream and the vowel as its arguments.

Include a loop in the program that lets the user repeat the above process for as many times as she/he wishes
to do so.

Now modify the program so that it writes the output both on the screen and also into a file named 'lab9O.txt'

Input-file text:
This is lab9A
Hello from line number two
This is not the last line

There is no more data!
